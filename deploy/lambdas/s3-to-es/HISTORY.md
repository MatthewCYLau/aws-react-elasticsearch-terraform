0.8 (2015-12-31)
================

This version introduces some behaviour changes designed to reduce the legwork needed when a signing key goes out of date. This has implications for multithreading and secret key storage. See the README for further details.

**New features**

-   AWS4Auth class now checks request header date against signing key
    scope date, and automatically regenerates the signing key with the
    request date if they don't match
-   Added exceptions module with new exceptions:
    RequestsAWS4AuthException, DateMismatchError, NoSecretKeyError, DateFormatError
-   Added StrictAWS4Auth and PassiveAWS4Auth classes

**AWS4Auth changes**

-   Added `regenerate_signing_key()` method, to allow regeneration of
    current signing key with parameter overrides
-   Added methods for checking and extracting dates from requests:
    `get_request_date()`, `parse_date()`, `handle_date_mismatch()`
-   `__call__()` now checks for a date header in the request and
    attempts to automatically regenerate the signing key with the
    request date if request date differs from the signing key date
-   Can now supply a date to the constructor
-   Changed default included sig headers to include `Date` header if
    present

**AWS4SigningKey changes**

-   Added new `store_secret_key` instantiation parameter which allows
    control of whether the secret key is stored in the instance
-   Deprecated the `amz_date` property in favour of just `date`
-   Spelling typo fix in AWS4AuthSigningKey module docstring. Thanks to jhgorrell

**Package changes**

-   Dropped support for Python 3.2. Now only supported on Python 2.7 and
    3.3 and up, to match versions supported by Requests.

**Tests**

-   Many new tests for the new functionality
-   Added tests for generating canonical path, including test for fix
    added in 0.7 for percent encoding of paths
-   Added tests for generating canonical querystrings

0.7 (2015-11-02)
================

**Bugfixes**

-   Fixed percent encoded characters in URL paths not being encoded
    again for signature generation, as is expected for all services
    except S3. This was causing authentication failures whenever these
    characters appeared in a URL. Thanks to ipartola and cristi23 for
    the report.
-   Two bugfixes for ElasticSearch, thanks to Matthew Thompson for both:
    -   No longer setting body to `b''` during signing if it's None
    -   Now stripping port from URL netloc for signature generation

**Modules**

-   Upgraded the included version of six.py to 1.10

**Tests**

-   Fixed a couple of broken Unicode tests on Python 2
-   Added a couple more tests for encoding Unicode request bodies

0.6 (2015-09-07)
================

**Bugfixes**

-   Included HISTORY.rst in built package to fix pip source install
    failure. Thanks to Beirdo for the bug report.

0.5 (2015-04-29)
================

**Bugfixes**

-   Fixed bug when uploading to S3 with x-amz-acl header which caused
    authentication failure - headers used in signature are now: host,
    content-type and all `x-amz-*` headers (except for
    x-amz-client-context which breaks Mobile Analytics auth if included)

**Docs**

-   Minor docstring and comment updates

**License**

-   Changed content of LICENSE to vanilla MIT license
